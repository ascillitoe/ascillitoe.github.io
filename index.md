I am a Research Fellow in the [Data-Centric Engineering for Aeronautics](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/digital-twins-aeronautics) group at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/), led by [Pranay Seshadri](https://www.psesh.com/).

My research explores the use of machine learning and statistical methods for tackling aerospace engineering problems, with data primarily coming from computational simulations. To encourage industrial uptake, much of my work is focused on developing approaches with uncertainty quantification and interpretability at the forefront. I am funded by the EPSRC and the Lloyd's Register Foundation, with previous projects including:

- Uncertainty quantification for data-driven turbulence modelling, using Mondrian forests.

- Rapid flowfield estimation via embedded ridge functions.

- Using dimension reduction techniques to tackle the curse of dimensionality in aerospace design tasks.

I am also a member of the [Effective Quadratures](https://www.effective-quadratures.org/) organisation, founded by [Pranay Seshadri](https://www.psesh.com/). Effective Quadratures provides a unique platform to build and deploy digital twins, fusing in sensor data with physics-based knowledge in a holistic and principled way. The foundation for this is our open-source python library [equadratures](https://github.com/Effective-Quadratures/Effective-Quadratures), which provides tools for uncertainty quantification, machine learning, optimisation, numerical integration and dimension reduction -- all using orthogonal polynomials.

My [PhD](https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/270030), completed in 2017, was supervised by [Prof. Paul Tucker](https://www.murrayedwards.cam.ac.uk/fellows/professor-paul-g-tucker) at the University of Cambridge. It involved working with [Rolls-Royce](https://www.rolls-royce.com/products-and-services/civil-aerospace.aspx) to examine the feasibility of modifying an industrial CFD code, in order to run high fidelity Large Eddy Simulation of flows seen in aero-engine compressors.
